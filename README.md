Passthepic-firbase
==================

A web app that allows you to send pictures immediately so you can share photos globally and can also be anonymous, due to registration less start.
The app works around a "code" assigned to each picture sent, so to share pictures globally with lots of people just requires you to share one code.  Also the web-app can be used to carry on a conversation like snapchat without having the app or having to register.
It acts like Snapchat because as you upload a new picture using the same code, then the previous picture gets removed, so only the last picture is viewable.
